# TODO: currently we make all executables run whenever an iface change event is
# triggered. This can be optimized by recording which interfaces were changed,
# and for what reason (e.g., ifup/ifupdate/ifdown) into a file. Executable can
# then decide if it wants to skip generating all together if the interfaces it
# is interested in were not changed.
#
# This can complicate the design a lot, not implement it until it's proven that
# the current design can be unacceptablely slow
